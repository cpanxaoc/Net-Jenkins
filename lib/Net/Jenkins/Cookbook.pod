=head1 TODO

=over

=item How to use L<LWP::UserAgent> 

For Jenkins hosts that need Basic/Digest/NTLM authentication

=item Retrieving the Jenkins version

=item Retrieving the next Jenkins job number

So when you start a new job, you can check it.  Or is this important now with
L<Net::Jenkins::Job>?
